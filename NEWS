AsyncHBase - User visible and noteworthy changes.
This project uses Semantic Versioning (see http://semver.org/).

* Version 1.5.0 (2013-??-??) [???????]


* Version 1.4.1 (2013-02-14) [1cbc303]

Noteworthy bug fixes:
  - Under certain failure modes, especially during RegionServer failures
    or regions split, asynchbase could incorrectly discard an RPC instead
    of retrying it.  This made the client look like it was stuck if the
    RPC was a ROOT or META lookup (#1).
  - Update all dependencies.  Due to new dependencies in Junit and PowerMock,
    asynchbase now depends on hamcrest-core and objenesis respectively.
    These are test-only dependencies.
  - Maven releases are now signed with the GPG key of tsunanet@gmail.com


* Version 1.4.0 (2012-11-10) [fae1a04]

New public APIs:
  - Scanners can now scan multiple qualifiers at a time (#35).
  - Scanner and GetRequest now enable you to specify how many versions
    to read from HBase.

Noteworthy changes:
  - Fixed cases where calling `flush()' or `shutdown()' while the
    client is still starting up could cause it to terminate too early
    and to not execute all pending/buffered RPCs (#2).
  - Fixed an RPC serialization bug when batching whole-row deletes.
    See issue #25.
  - The Deferred returned by `flush()' now guarantees that buffered
    atomic increments have also completed (#38).
  - Upgraded to Netty 3.5.9 to avoid an IndexOutOfBoundsException
    when deserializing a KeyValue with an empty qualifier or
    value, under certain circumstances (#40).
  - Fix increment coalescing to prevent overflowing Deferred callback
    chains when too many increments pile up for some counter (#40).
  - Increment coalescing now also supports negative values as well as
    large positive values (previously the limit was 65535).
  - Upgraded to suasync 1.3.1 and Netty 3.5.9.
  - Added a series of integration tests to help ongoing QA.


* Version 1.3.2 (2012-07-10) [2af9f55]

Noteworthy changes:
  - Upgraded to Netty 3.5.2.
  - KeyValue now allows a timestamp of 0.


* Version 1.3.1 (2012-06-16) [7ea151b]

  - Critical bug fix of issue #27 that makes some keys unusable
    given certain region boundaries, in rare circumstances.
  - `ensureTableFamilyExists' and `ensureTableExists' are cheaper
    as they partially work around HBASE-3170.


* Version 1.3.0 (2012-05-06) [bb9168c]

New public APIs:
  - PleaseThrottleException can now give you a Deferred.
  - There is now a `Counter' class that provides a highly concurrent
    replacement for AtomicLong from jsr166e's LongAdder.
  - HBaseClient now has a `bufferAtomicIncrement' method used to
    coalesce atomic counter increments.
  - A new method, `stats()', provides detailed statistics on the client's
    activities (number of calls for various RPCs, number of connections
    created, etc.)
  - `HBaseClient' has a new `compareAndSet(PutRequests, byte[])' method
    for atomic Compare-And-Set (CAS) operation.
  - The Scanner has new methods to allow specifying a time range to scan.
  - `PutRequest' has extra constructors so as to be able to affect multiple
    columns in a row.  This is required to be able to atomically CAS more
    than one column at a time on a given row.

Deprecated public APIs:
  - In HBaseClient, the methods `rootLookupCount()',
    `uncontendedMetaLookupCount()', and `contendedMetaLookupCount()' are
    deprecated in favor of the new `stats()' API.  These methods will be
    removed in the 2.0 release.

Noteworthy changes:
  - Upgraded to Netty 3.4.3, suasync to 1.2.0.
  - asynchbase now depends on Google's Guava library (v12.0).


* Version 1.2.0 (2012-02-21) [a7ae238]

Noteworthy changes:
  - Add support for HBase 0.92, as the on-wire RPC format underwent
    significant changes that aren't compatible with previous versions.
    NOTE: HBase never had a release in the 0.91 branch, and as such
    this branch isn't fully supported.
  - When talking to HBase 0.92, we automatically batch `DeleteRequests'
    with `PutRequests'.  Note that batching is enabled by default, and
    will thus introduce a delay before sending out `DeleteRequests' to
    HBase, whereas in earlier versions (or when talking to HBase 0.90
    and before) the `DeleteRequests' are sent out immediately.

New public APIs:
  - KeyValue now supports timestamps.
  - HBaseClient now accepts a custom socket factory or executor, which can
    be used to share an existing thread pool instead of having its own.
  - The Netty Timer used by asynchbase is now available through an API, so
    that code dependent on asynchbase can re-use the existing Timer thread
    instead of having to create its own.


* Version 1.1.0 (2011-12-22) [1272a9e]

Noteworthy changes:
  - Add support for CDH3b3's non-standard authentication code.  This support
    is enabled by specifying the Java system property "org.hbase.async.cdh3b3".
  - Add support for HBase 0.90, as on-wire protocol changed in a non-backward
    compatible way for the `get' RPC.
  - Fix a dumb mistake in the `memcmp()' version that uses an offset and a
    length.  This function wasn't called either by asynchbase or by OpenTSDB.
  - Bytes.pretty() no longer renders control characters like `^X' (which is
    similar to what `cat -t' does).  Instead they're now rendered like other
    non-ASCII characters, using the hex notation `\xXX'.  This makes the output
    non-ambiguous and pastable into a Python shell.
  - HBaseClient.shutdown() could callback too early, while the shutdown
    sequence was still running.
  - After doing a full-table scan, calling Scanner.close() would trigger an
    error as the scanner would attempt to close itself again.
  - When disconnecting from a RegionServer, if the socket wasn't getting
    closed immediately, a Deferred could get called back twice, which would
    trigger an AssertionError.
  - DeleteRequest used to delete the last version of a cell, which wasn't the
    intended behavior.  It has been changed to delete all the previous
    versions of a cell.
  - Fixed various other race conditions during startup / shutdown that would
    generally affect short-lived programs or MapReduce users.

New public APIs:
  - DeleteRequest now has constructors for deleting multiple qualifiers per
    row at once and deleting a whole family at once.
  - New `qualifiers' method in GetRequest for getting multiple qualifiers per
    row at once.
  - Add new interfaces nested in `HBaseRpc' to provide public APIs to be able
    to introspect the contents of RPCs.


* Version 1.0 (2010-11-08) [dafc645]

Initial beta release (bundled with OpenTSDB):
  - Switched from LGPLv3+ to BSD license.
  - Fixed many bugs, including incorrect or inefficient error handling,
    synchronization bugs (race conditions).
  - Shutting down the client now correctly waits until all RPCs in flight
    have successfully completed.
  - No public API changes.


* Version 0.1 (2010-09-08) [d0646bb]

Initial alpha release:
  - Get, Put, Scan, ICV, with row locks and time-based edit buffering.
