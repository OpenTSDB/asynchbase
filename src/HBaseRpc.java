  /*
   * This class, although it's part of the public API, is mostly here to make
   * it easier for this library to manipulate the HBase RPC protocol.
   *
   *
   * Unofficial Hadoop / HBase RPC protocol documentation
   * ****************************************************
   *
   * HBase uses a modified version of the Hadoop RPC protocol.  They took
   * Hadoop's RPC code, copy-pasted it into HBase, and tweaked it a little
   * bit (mostly in a desperate attempt to try to make it less inefficient).
   *
   * RPCs are numbered with an arbitrary 32-bit ID.  It is customary, but not
   * mandatory, to start at 0 and increment by 1 every time you send out an
   * RPC.  The ID is allowed to wrap around and become negative.  As long as
   * no 2 RPCs share the same ID at the same time, we're fine.
   *
   * When requests are written out to the wire, they're framed.  Meaning, a
   * 4 byte integer value is first written in order to specify how many bytes
   * are in the request (excluding the first 4 bytes themselves).  The size -1
   * is special.  The client uses it to send a "ping" to the server at regular
   * intervals, and the server specifically ignores any RPC with size -1.  We
   * don't do this in this client, because it's mostly useless, and we rely on
   * TCP keepalive instead.
   *
   * Then the RPC ID is written (4 bytes).  BTW, all integer values are
   * encoded in big endian, as it's the default in Java world (Sun, SPARC...).
   *
   * Then the length of the method name is written on 2 bytes (I guess 1 byte
   * wasn't enough in case you wanted to have 32768 byte long method names).
   *
   * Then the method name itself is written as-is (as a byte array).
   *
   * The last 4 fields are what constitute the "RPC header".  The remaining
   * bytes are the parameters of the request.  First, there is a 4-byte int
   * that specifies how many parameters follow (this way you can have up to
   * 2 147 483 648 parameters, which may come in handy in a few centuries).
   *
   * In HBase 0.92 and above, 3 more fields have been added in the header as
   * previously described.  The first is a one byte version number that comes
   * right before the method name, indicating how the parameters of the RPC
   * have been serialized.  Then there is a 8 byte (!) client version that's
   * right after the method name, followed by a 4 byte "fingerprint", which
   * is a sort of hash code of the method's signature (name, return type, and
   * parameters types).  Note that the client version seems to be always set
   * to zero...
   *
   * In Hadoop RPC, the name of the class is first serialized (2 bytes
   * specifying the length of the string, followed by that number of bytes
   * of a UTF-8 encoded string in case you name your classes with Kanjis).
   * In HBase RPC, a 1-byte ID representing the class name is written instead
   * of writing the full class name.  Those IDs are hard-coded in a central
   * location (`HbaseObjectWritable', HBase's copy-pasted-hacked version of
   * Hadoop's `ObjectWritable').
   *
   * The way each parameter is serialized depends on the object type being
   * serialized.  Since Hadoop doesn't use any automatic serialization
   * framework, every class is free to serialize itself however it wants.
   * The way it works is that for built-in types, they'll handle the
   * serialization manually, and for other objects, they require that those
   * objects implement their `Writable' interface which requires that a method
   * named `readFields' and a method named `write' be implemented to
   * de-serialize / serialize the object.  So since the RPC layer knows the
   * name of the class of the parameter, it will grab its `Class' using the
   * Java Classloader and then `newInstance' it and then use `readFields' to
   * populate the newly created instance.  Thankfully most objects use a
   * common library to serialize their own fields recursively, however things
   * aren't always consistent, particularly when HBase chose to diverge from
   * Hadoop in certain (but not all) code paths.
   *
   * The way RPC responses are encoded is as follows.  First comes the 4-byte
   * RPC ID.  Then 1 byte containing flags indicating whether or not the
   * request failed (0x01) on the remote side, and whether the response is
   * framed (0x02).  If flags are only 0x00, this is an old-style (pre 0.92)
   * successful response that is not framed.  Framed responses contain a
   * 4-byte integer with the length of the entire response, including the
   * leading RPC ID, flags, and the length itself.  If there is a length, it
   * is always followed by a 4-byte integer with the state of the RPC follows.
   * As of 0.92, this state mostly useless.  If the request failed (flag 0x01
   * is set), the rest of the response is just 2 Hadoop-encoded
   * strings (2-byte length, followed by a UTF-8 string).  The first string is
   * the name of the class of the exception and the second is the message of
   * the exception (which typically includes some of the server-side stack
   * trace).  Note that if the response is NOT framed, it's not easy to tell
   * ahead of time how many bytes to expect or where the next response starts.
   *
   * If the RPC was successful, the remaining of the payload is serialized
   * using the same method as the RPC parameters are serialized (see above).
   *
   * Before the very first RPC, the server expects a "hello" message that
   * starts with 4-byte magic number, followed by the RPC version (1 byte).
   * Then comes 4 bytes to specify the rest of the length of the "hello"
   * message.  The remaining is a `Writable' instance serialized that
   * specifies which authentication provider to use and give our credentials.
   * In HBase 0.92 and above, the `Writable' should represent what protocol
   * the client wants to speak, which should be the name of an interface.
   * "org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.HRegionInterface" should be used.
   * The "hello" message is implemented in `RegionClient#helloRpc'.  In order
   * to support HBase 0.92, we always piggy back a `getProtocolVersion' RPC
   * right after the header, so we can tell what version the server is using
   * and how to serialize RPCs and read its responses.

  /*
   * Unofficial documentation of the Hadoop VLong encoding
   * *****************************************************
   *
   * The notation used to refer to binary numbers here is `0b' followed by
   * the bits, as is printed by Python's built-in `bin' function for example.
   *
   * Values between
   *   -112 0b10010000
   * and
   *    127 0b01111111
   * (inclusive) are encoded on a single byte using their normal
   * representation.  The boundary "-112" sounds weird at first (and it is)
   * but it'll become clearer once you understand the format.
   *
   * Values outside of the boundaries above are encoded by first having
   * 1 byte of meta-data followed by a variable number of bytes that make up
   * the value being encoded.
   *
   * The "meta-data byte" always starts with the prefix 0b1000.  Its format
   * is as follows:
   *   1 0 0 0 | S | L L L
   * The bit `S' is the sign bit (1 = positive value, 0 = negative, yes
   * that's weird, I would've done it the other way around).
   * The 3 bits labeled `L' indicate how many bytes make up this variable
   * length value.  They're encoded like so:
   *   1 1 1 = 1 byte follows
   *   1 1 0 = 2 bytes follow
   *   1 0 1 = 3 bytes follow
   *   1 0 0 = 4 bytes follow
   *   0 1 1 = 5 bytes follow
   *   0 1 0 = 6 bytes follow
   *   0 0 1 = 7 bytes follow
   *   0 0 0 = 8 bytes follow
   * Yes, this is weird too, it goes backwards, requires more operations to
   * convert the length into something human readable, and makes sorting the
   * numbers unnecessarily complicated.
   * Notice that the prefix wastes 3 bits.  Also, there's no "VInt", all
   * variable length encoded values are eventually transformed to `long'.
   *
   * The remaining bytes are just the original number, as-is, without the
   * unnecessary leading bytes (that are all zeroes).
   *
   * Examples:
   *   42 is encoded as                   00101010 (as-is, 1 byte)
   *  127 is encoded as                   01111111 (as-is, 1 bytes)
   *  128 is encoded as          10001111 10000000 (2 bytes)
   *  255 is encoded as          10001111 11111111 (2 bytes)
   *  256 is encoded as 10001110 00000001 00000000 (3 bytes)
   *   -1 is encoded as                   11111111 (as-is, 1 byte)
   *  -42 is encoded as                   11010110 (as-is, 1 byte)
   * -112 is encoded as                   10010000 (as-is, 1 byte)
   * -113 is encoded as          10000111 01110000 (2 bytes)
   * -256 is encoded as          10000111 11111111 (2 bytes)
   * -257 is encoded as 10000110 00000001 00000000 (3 bytes)
   *
   * The implementations of writeVLong and readVLong below are on average
   * 14% faster than Hadoop's implementation given a uniformly distributed
   * input (lots of values of all sizes), and can be up to 40% faster on
   * certain input sizes (e.g. big values that fit on 8 bytes).  This is due
   * to two main things: fewer arithmetic and logic operations, and processing
   * multiple bytes together when possible.
   * Reading is about 6% faster than writing (negligible difference).
   * My MacBook Pro with a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo easily does 5000 calls to
   * readVLong or writeVLong per millisecond.
   *
   * However, since we use Netty, we don't have to deal with the stupid Java
   * I/O library, so unlike Hadoop we don't use DataOutputStream and
   * ByteArrayOutputStream, instead we use ChannelBuffer.  This gives us a
   * significant extra performance boost over Hadoop.  The 14%-60% difference
   * above becomes a 70% to 80% difference!  Yes, that's >4 times faster!  With
   * the code below my MacBook Pro with a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo easily
   * does 11000 writeVLong/ms or 13500 readVLong/ms (notice that reading is
   * 18% faster) when using a properly sized dynamicBuffer.  When using a
   * fixed-size buffer, writing (14200/s) is almost as fast as reading
   * (14500/s).
   *
   * So there's really no reason on Earth to use java.io.  Its API is horrible
   * and so is its performance.
