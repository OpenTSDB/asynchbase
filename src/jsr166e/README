The contents of this directory contains code from JSR 166e.
** THIS IS NOT PART OF THE PUBLIC INTERFACE OF ASYNCHBASE **

Code was downloaded from:
  http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/

The code was released to the public domain, as explained at
  http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

The code is bundled in asynchbase as it is not available until JDK8
becomes a reality, which is expected to take years (at time of writing).
Ideally another library, such as Google Guava, would provide this
code until JDK8 becomes the norm.  But in the mean time it's here
for asynchbase's internal use.
